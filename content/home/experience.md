          * Adressed the phrase grounding accuracy problem as the primary researcher.
          * Devised a novel model to capture complex spatial and semantic relationship among image regions and phrases through multi-level multi-modal interactin.
          * THe new method improved the grounding accuracy for 6.15% on Flickr30K Entities and 21.25% on ReferItGame.
